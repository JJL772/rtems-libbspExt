 Changes since release 1.2-beta:
	- IABR handler support
	- improved DABR support
	- ABI for hooking into exception handler
	- merged Kate Feng's modifications for supporting 7450 CPUs
    - don't enable MCP in hid0 fi clear_hostbridge_errors() returns -1
      (give the BSP a chance to indicate that there *is* no MCP line)
 Changes since release 1.1-beta:
	- wrapped the braindead IRQ API of the 'new exception handling' BSPs.
      The new API allows for interrupt sharing (crucial for PCI) and
      passing an ISR argument (also crucial for PCI / shared interrupts).
